## Data Science Getting Started

### Installing Python, Postgres, and Jupyter Notebook
Hack Oregon projects frequently use Python programs to clean, input, transform, analyze, persist, and present data.  For persistence, most project start with Postgres and move to other technologies as necessary, so we have included an installation of Postgres as well.  Two commonly used Python-based tools are Mini-Conda (an implementation of the Python interpreter) and Jupyter Notebook (a web-based interface for creating, testing, and running Python programs).

###Installing Data Science Tools by using a Virtual Machine

* To make things easier to install and configure, we have pre-installed all of them into a virtual machine, and [provide step-by-step instructions for installing, configuring, and using this virtual machine](https://github.com/hackoregon/getting-started/blob/master/datascience/linux-laptop-setup/Using_the_VirtualBox_OVA.md).  We recommend using this method so that everyone doing data science can have a common enviroment for data science (i.e. Jupyter Notebook, Postgres SQL, Python 3) without the hassle of installing and configuring these componenets on separate operating systems (mac, windows, linux).
