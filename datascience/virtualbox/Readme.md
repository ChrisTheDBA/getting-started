These are the instructions for using an existing virtual box instance (*.ova file) to install and use a python interpreter (miniconda), jupyter notebook, and a postgres server.

First, it's necessary to install Virtual Box on your operating system.   To Download and install Virtual Box see

#### [Download and install the appropriate version of VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

Then download the Hack Oregon Base OVA file.   This file is ~4gb in size and is available via Google Drive [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2VTjTSmFU2lWnJUQTR3T3NQdTg).   

Note that if possible, it would be best to get this file off of a thumb drive or some other non-network source, as it will take a very long time to download on slow or congested networks.
