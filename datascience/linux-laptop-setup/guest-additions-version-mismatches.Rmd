## Background
Both the Hack Oregon Base Open Virtualization Archive (OVA) and Vagrant box have the VirtualBox guest additions pre-installed using the version of VirtualBox I had installed when I created them, 5.0.28 r111378. Any version of VirtualBox 5.0 or greater will work, but if you're using something other than 5.0.28 r111378 you will get a warning from Vagrant.

## How to update the guest additions
1. Log in to the virtual machine. If you're using the Vagrant box, just do `vagrant ssh`. If you're using the OVA, log in on the console as `vagrant`, or do `ssh vagrant@localhost -p2222` from a host terminal.
2. Do
    ```
    cd ~/getting-started/datascience/linux-laptop-setup
    git checkout master
    git pull
    ./install-guest-additions
    ```
    
    The script will talk you through the process.
