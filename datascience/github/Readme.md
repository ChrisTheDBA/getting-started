# Using Hack Oregon Github Repositories

The [Hack Oregon Oranization at github is located here](https://github.com/hackoregon).  Within this organization are a number of git repositories, that will be used by the Hack Oregon projects and others to store with version control documents, data sources, programs, and other artifacts produced.

## Get a GitHub login

If you do not already have one, please create a github account for yourself.   You may create a github account by going to [this Github page](https://github.com/join)

## Using Git

Github repos are accessed via git clients.   For example, there is the original git command line client.  There are also graphical git clients, and there are git clients built into common Itegrated Development Environments (IDEs).

To start, one can simply use the web browser to access quite a lot of functionality of a git repository.  For example, [clicking here](https://github.com/hackoregon/education-data) will allow one to browse the content in the repo, clone or download the entire repo (green button on the right), and edit existing text files, add new files and/or directories.  

If you haven't used git before, I suggest you start by using the web client.  If you have, then you probably already know which client (GUI or command line) that you prefer.

Note that it's common to combine/use several git clients although not necessary.  All of the clients (including the web browser) interoperate with one another without any difficulty and so if you are getting what you need with one client, you can stay with it.   No need to use any of the clients below if you don't need them.

## GUI Client

A good choice for GitHub GUI would be the [Github Desktop Client](https://desktop.github.com/).  Alternatively there are a number of free and commercial GUI clients for git.  See [here](https://git-scm.com/download/gui/linux)).   If you choose to use a client with a license cost, please remember that you are responsible for the meeting the licensing terms.

## Command-Line Client

For the lover of command line interfaces, there is the (original) git command line client.  [Here are instructions for installing the git command line clients on linux, mac, and windows](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
