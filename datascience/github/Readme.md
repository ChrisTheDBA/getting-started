# Using Hack Oregon Github Repositories

The [Hack Oregon Oranization at github is located here](https://github.com/hackoregon).  Within this organization are a number of git repositories, that will be used by the Hack Oregon projects and others to store with version control documents, data sources, programs, and other artifacts produced.

## Using Git for Hack Oregon Projects

Github repos are accessed via git clients.   For example, there is the original git command line client.  There are also graphical git clients, and there are git clients built into common Itegrated Development Environments (IDEs).

To start, one can simply use the web browser to access quite a lot of functionality of a git repository.  For example, [clicking here](https://github.com/hackoregon/education-data) will allow one to browse the content in the repo, clone or download the entire repo (green button on the right), and edit existing text files, add new files and/or directories.  

If you haven't used git before, I suggest you start by using the web client.

Note that it's common to combine/use several git clients although not necessary.  All of the clients (including the web browser) interoperate with one another without any difficulty and so if you are getting what you need with one client, you can stay with it.   No need to use any of the clients below if you don't need them.

## GUI Clients

There are quite a lot of Git GUI Clients.   For example, see [here](https://git-scm.com/download/gui/linux)).   A good choice for GitHub usage specifically would be the [Github Desktop Client](https://desktop.github.com/).

## Command-Line Client

For the lover of command line interfaces, there is the (original) git command line client.  [Here are instructions for installing the git command line clients on linux, mac, and windows](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
