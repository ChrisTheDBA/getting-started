## What you will need
1. Git ... since the Hack Oregon repositories live on GitHub, install the GitHub Desktop from <https://desktop.github.com/>.
2. If you need to capture screenshots, install Sizer (<http://www.brianapps.net/sizer/>) and Greenshot (<http://getgreenshot.org/>). I captured the screenshots for this tutorial with them.

Open source installation on Windows can be frustrating. The developers try their best to make things easy, but you may still find it frustrating. Please, do yourself a favor and read through all of the instructions below once before you start going to websites, downloading packages and installing them.

## Miniconda
Download the installer at <http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>. The 64-bit installer is at <https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe> and the 32-bit installer is at <https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86.exe>. Double-click the installer to start it.

## PostgreSQL
1. Go to <http://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads> and download the installer. ***Make sure you get the 9.5 release; that's what the Database Engineering class is using.***

    Download links:
    
    * 64-bit Windows: <http://www.enterprisedb.com/postgresql-955-installers-win64>
    * 32-bit Windows: <http://www.enterprisedb.com/postgresql-955-installers-win32>
    * MacOS: <http://www.enterprisedb.com/postgresql-955-installers-osx>

1. Double-click the installer. You'll need to authorize the install, then after a few operations you'll get this screen. Press "Next".

## PostGIS
The EnterpriseDB installer you just ran added some tools to your menu. Among these is Stack Builder, which you'll use to install PostGIS. Start Stack Builder now.

1. This is the first screen you'll get from Stack Builder. Pull down the drop-down and select the PostgreSQL database you just installed. Then press "Next".

    ![](Screenshots/2016-11-08 15_32_59.png)
1. You will get a screen with a menu of available add-ons. Expand the "Spatial Extensions" item with the plus sign. Choose PostGIS 2.2. Choose 32-bit or 64-bit depending on whether you installed 32-bit or 64-bit PostgreSQL. In my case, it was 64-bit. Then press "Next".

    Note that Stack Builder is not very tidy about whether it's actually done the PostGIS install. Under some circumstances it will think it did when it only downloaded the installer. So always select the PostGIS option even if you installed it before.

1. On the review screen, accept the default download location and press "Next". This will download the installer for PostGIS.
